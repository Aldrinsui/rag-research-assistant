Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention and adjust actions accordingly.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error with rewards and penalties.

Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. Modern ML heavily relies on neural networks and deep learning architectures.
